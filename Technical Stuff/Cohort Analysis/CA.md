Breaking down data from a dataset into related groups for analysis over a specific period of time.

Why is Cohort Analysis important in Product Management? <br>
By performing cohort analysis, you can then track the performance of each cohort as a product manager over time, 
looking at metrics such as:

 * Retention rate: What percentage of customers from each cohort return to make a second purchase, third purchase, and so on?
 * Average order value: How much do customers from each cohort spend on average per order?
 * Lifetime value: How much revenue do customers from each cohort generate over their lifetime as a customer?
   
These metrics are very important for PMs to track company growth.
