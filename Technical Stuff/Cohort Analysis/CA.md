<h5>What is a Cohort?</h5>
A cohort is simply a group of people with shared characteristics.

<h5>What is Cohort Analysis?</h5>
Breaking down data from a dataset into related groups for analysis over a specific period of time.

<h5>Why is Cohort Analysis important in Product Management?</h5>
By performing cohort analysis, you can then track the performance of each cohort as a product manager over time, 
looking at metrics such as:

 * Retention rate: What percentage of customers from each cohort return to make a second purchase, third purchase, and so on?
 * Average order value: How much do customers from each cohort spend on average per order?
 * Lifetime value: How much revenue do customers from each cohort generate over their lifetime as a customer?
   
These metrics are very important for PMs to track company growth.
